<h1>How To Use</h1>

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">The Virginia-Highland Master Plan is now underway and as part of the process the planning team would like to hear from the community. This interactive tool will enable the project planners to understand your neighborhood better by seeing what you see and knowing what you know. Use the map to record and share the things you love about Virginia-Highland and the things you want to see changed or fixed in Virginia-Highland.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">To identify an area on the map that you would like to address, click and drag the "+" on the desired location on the map. A window will open for you to provide comments tied to your noted location. All recorded comments will be viewable and able to be additionally commented on by other users.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">The Virginia-Highland Master Plan is a comprehensive community planning initiative funded by the Virginia-Highland Civic Association.
